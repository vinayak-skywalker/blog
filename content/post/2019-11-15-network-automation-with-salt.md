Salt helps in building an event-driven orchestration and automation of the infrastructure. We've added a lesson [Network Automation with Salt](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=30&lessonStage=1) to the NRE labs.

The lesson [Network Automation with Salt](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering/labs/?lessonId=30&lessonStage=1) doesn't expect you to have any prior experience with Salt. It walks you through the very basics of what a master and minion is, how to configure & setup Salt and all the way up to orchestrating the Junos Device (vqfx). The NRE labs provides the virtual lab environment with which the user not only gets to read about Salt but also gets a hands on experience in setting up salt and orchestrating the Junos device in your own browser. Learn how to quickly setup the Salt Master and minion and get the environment running. See how easy it is to execute remote commands on minions. Go through what it takes to setup a proxy minion in order to manage a Junos device. Learn about State files and pillars and what their role is in the Salt ecosystem. Also, execute RPC's on to a Junos proxy minion and gather a whole range of information about the device configuration without having to access the cli.
